	<p id=descript><b>Description:-</b></p> 
	 <p class="para">Customer relationship management (CRM) is a term that refers
	 to practices, strategies and technologies that companies use to
	 manage and analyze customer interactions and data throughout the 
	 customer lifecycle, with the goal of improving business
	 relationships with customers, assisting in customer retention and 
	 driving sales growth. CRM systems are designed to compile information
	 on customers across different channels -- or points of contact between
	 the customer and the company -- which could include the company's website, 
	 telephone, live chat, direct mail, marketing materials and social media. 
	 CRM systems can also give customer-facing staff detailed
	 information on customers' personal information, purchase history, buying preferences and concerns</p>
